## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shravanij05/BrailleConnect.git
cd BrailleConnect
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For detailed setup instructions, DroidCam configuration, troubleshooting, and camera setup, refer to:

📄 [SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

For a detailed explanation of the complete project workflow, dataset usage, model training pipeline, detection logic, translation process, and technical architecture, refer to:

📄 [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md)

## Running the Application

Start the Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

Open the local URL displayed in the terminal.

### Webcam Setup

After launching the dashboard:

1. In the **Camera Settings** section in the sidebar.
2. Set **Camera Index** to:

```text
0
```

3. Click **Start Camera** to begin Braille detection.

> Note: For most systems, index `0` corresponds to the default webcam. If the camera does not open, use `find_camera.py` to identify the correct camera index.

---

## Model Evaluation

To evaluate the trained YOLO model:

```bash
python accuracy.py
```

This displays:

- Accuracy (mAP50)
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

---

## Camera Utility

To identify available camera indices:

```bash
python find_camera.py
```

Use the detected camera index in the dashboard settings if required.

## Dataset

The Braille detection model was trained using a custom Braille dataset annotated for object detection.

Dataset Source:
https://universe.roboflow.com/braille-eitpg/braille-detection-f0rb5

**Annotation Format:** YOLO

The dataset consists of annotated Braille character images used for training and evaluating the detection model.

## Project Documentation

The repository contains additional files and folders that support training, evaluation, deployment, and testing of the BrailleConnect system.

### Core Application Files

| File | Description |
|--------|--------|
| `dashboard.py` | Main Streamlit application used for real-time Braille recognition and translation. |
| `find_camera.py` | Utility script used to identify available camera indices on the system. |
| `accuracy.py` | Evaluation script used to calculate model performance metrics such as Accuracy (mAP50), Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. |
| `svm_braille.pkl` | Trained SVM verification model used to validate Braille character predictions. |

---

### Documentation

| File | Description |
|--------|--------|
| `README.md` | Project overview, features, architecture, and usage instructions. |
| `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Detailed installation guide, DroidCam setup, camera configuration, troubleshooting, and deployment instructions. |
| `WORKFLOW.md` | Complete project workflow covering dataset usage, model training, evaluation, detection pipeline, translation logic, technical architecture, and deployment process. |

---

### Training Resources

The `training/` folder contains files used during model development and training.

| File | Description |
|--------|--------|
| `train_yolo.py` | YOLOv8 training script for Braille character detection. |

---

### Model Evaluation Resources

The `model_metrics/` folder contains evaluation results and training artifacts.

It includes ontents include:

- Confusion Matrix
- Precision Curve
- Recall Curve
- F1 Score Curve
- Precision-Recall Curve
- Training Results Graphs

---

### Sample Inputs and Outputs

The `samples/` folder contains example Braille images along with their corresponding expected recognition outputs. These samples can be used for testing, demonstrations, and validating the performance of the system without requiring a live camera feed.

#### Contents

| Folder | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `sample_input/` | Contains sample Braille images that can be used as test inputs for the model. |
| `sample_output/` | Contains the corresponding expected detection and recognition outputs generated by BrailleConnect. |

Each file in `sample_input/` has a corresponding expected output in `sample_output/`.

For example:

- `001.png` → `001_op.jpeg`
- `002.png` → `002_op.jpeg`

## Future Improvements

- Support for Grade 2 Braille
- Multi-line Braille paragraph recognition
- Mobile application integration
- OCR-assisted document alignment
- Cloud-based translation and accessibility services
- Multi Language Support

---

## Accessibility Impact

BrailleConnect aims to bridge the communication gap between Braille users and non-Braille readers by providing instant translation and speech output, making Braille content more accessible in educational and everyday environments.
